<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiastic person, I love to travel and explore new cultures. The best place I ever travelled to was Iceland and Australia.
  Two very different sides of the world but both left me speachless and grateful for life.</p>

<p>I studied Criminal Psychology - I did not like it so I moved on to Event Management and even though I love to manage things 
  I did not like the course either. I found myself graduating from the univeristy and not having any potential work path. 
After two years of searching and exploring I decided to give programming a go! </p>

<p>What I really want in life is balance, happiness and family. Currently I have them all so I am a very happy and satisfied person. 
  I hope programming will bring me more self-satisfaction.</p>
